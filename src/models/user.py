"""
User, Role, and UserRole models.

This module defines:
- User: Core user model with authentication and profile information
- Role: Role definition with JSONB permissions
- UserRole: Many-to-many junction table between User and Role

Architecture:
- Users can have multiple roles (many-to-many relationship)
- Roles contain permissions as JSONB array
- Permissions follow format: resource:action[:scope]
  Examples: "users:read:self", "users:write:all", "audit_logs:read:all"

    Role model for role-based access control (RBAC).

        id: UUID primary key

        - "users:delete:all" - Delete users (admin)
        - "audit_logs:read:self" - View own audit logs
        - "audit_logs:read:all" - View all audit logs (admin)
        - "transactions:read:self" - View own transactions
