Please review the database entry creation guidelines in .claude/best-practices/entity-search-guide.md and audit my current codebase against these standards.

Provide:
1. A summary of which parts of the codebase don't follow these guidelines
2. A refactoring plan that reimplements all affected methods and components to comply with the guidelines
3. The refactored code with complete breaking changes - no backward compatibility needed

Proceed with the full refactor, replacing all non-compliant implementations.

---

I want to refactor everything that is related to search/list implementations in my codebase. I want to follow the guidelines of this file. So please, analyze the codebase and check what needs to be removed (Pydantic schemas, unuseful methods, etc.), and then implement the best practices in this guide for each entity.
