Please review the database entry creation guidelines in .claude/best-practices/database-entry-update-flow.md and audit my current codebase against these standards.

Provide:
1. A summary of which parts of the codebase don't follow these guidelines
2. A refactoring plan that reimplements all affected methods and components to comply with the guidelines
3. The refactored code with complete breaking changes - no backward compatibility needed

Proceed with the full refactor, replacing all non-compliant implementations.
