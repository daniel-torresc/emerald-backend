description: Create a detailed implementation plan for a feature based on its description and, 
optionally, prior research findings.

## Implementation Request

You are tasked with implementing a project feature.

Before you begin, carefully read and analyze all provided files to fully understand the context, 
objectives, and detailed implementation steps. 

You must always read the **feature description file** and the **implementation plan file**.  
If a **research file** is provided, also read it and take into account any relevant insights, 
recommendations, or constraints documented there. 

Your implementation must strictly follow the plan and remain aligned with the featureâ€™s original 
goals and requirements. 

- **Feature description file:** $1  
- **Research file (optional):** $2
- **Implementation plan file:** $3  

$4

## Strategy by Size

### ðŸ”¹ XS/S Tasks (< 200 lines)

**Mode:** 100% automated

**Process:**
1. Implement all changes sequentially
2. Run tests
3. Generate PR automatically

**Does not require active supervision.**

---

### ðŸ”¸ M/L Tasks (5-10+ files)

**Mode:** Active supervision

**Process:**
1. **CONFIRM WITH HUMAN before starting**
2. Implement file by file according to plan order
3. **After each file:**
   - Show summary of changes
   - Wait for confirmation or adjustments
4. Run tests after critical components

**Human can press ESC to stop.**

---

## Strict Rules

1. **Follow the plan to the letter**
   - If something isn't in the plan â†’ DON'T improvise
   - If a problem arises â†’ STOP and consult

2. **Sequential implementation**
   - One file at a time
   - Respect specified order
   - Don't skip steps

3. **Continuous self-validation**
   - Tests after each change
   - Verify nothing breaks
   - Confirm correct imports

4. **Clear communication**
   - Announce which file you're modifying
   - Summarize changes after each file
   - Report any deviation

5. **Tools $ MCPs**: 
   - Use the tools or MCPs available to validate implementation (e.g. "playwright" for frontend 
     checks, etc.)  

## Communication Format

**When starting a file:**
```
ðŸ”§ Modifying: src/components/NewComponent.tsx
Purpose: [from plan]
```

**When completing a file:**
```
âœ… Completed: src/components/NewComponent.tsx

Changes made:
- Created component with userId and onComplete props
- Implemented loading/error/data state
- Added edge cases for invalid userId

Tests: âœ… Passing
```

## Deliverable

Your main deliverable is the plan implementation, with testing and PR ready to be merged to `main`.

However, it's useful to also save a summary of the process carried out in your implementation. 
Do it when I tell you that everything is correct and that we can end the session. Ask me for 
confirmation. When approved save this summary in a markdown file named:

**`.features/implementation/YYYYMMDD_{short-informative-title}.md`**

Where:

- `YYYYMMDD` is today's date (e.g., 20251013)
- `{short-informative-title}` is a brief, descriptive name for the 
  idea/feature using lowercase with hyphens (e.g., "ai-powered-code-review", 
  "real-time-collaboration", "user-authentication-system")

Example filename: `20251013_ai-powered-code-review.md`

## Post-Implementation

1. **Human performs manual testing**
2. **Superficial code review** (20% of time)
   - Focus on integration, not details
3. **If plan was perfect â†’ code will be correct**
